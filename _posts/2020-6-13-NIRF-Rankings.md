title: NIRF India Rankings 2020
---

The NIRF India Rankings 2020 were released yesterday. The 5 parameters for ranking the various institutions are:

1. Teaching, Learning & Resources (TLR)
1. Research and Professional Practice (RPC)
1. Graduation Outcomes (GO)
1. Outreach and Inclusivity (OI)
1. Perception (PERCEPTION)

The weights given to each of these parameters for generating the overall score are arbitrary.
Also, the first 4 parameters are calculated based on self-reporting by the institutions being ranked which is not an ideal scenario.
The institutions have an incentive to pump these numbers up to get a better rank especially if their funding relies on this ranking.

Another issue with using the first 4 parameters is the bias towards technical disciplines. For example, one of the major components of the TLR score is Financial Resources and their Utilisation (FRU).
It is clear that this score will be higher for engineering and medical institutions due to the high costs of equipment used in their labs.

To avoid these issues and present a fairer picture, I've re-ranked the institutions based on the PERCEPTION score alone.
